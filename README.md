# query_object

This is a simple implementation of Query Object Design Pattern in PHP.

Why? Years ago when I was first learning PHP, I wrote something similar to practice, based on the implementation present in [Pablo Dallâ€™Oglio PHP book](https://novatec.com.br/livros/php-orientacao-objetos-4ed/). I decided to write it again, doing some improvements, with no other goal in mind.
