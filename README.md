# query_object_php

This is a simple implementation of Query Object Design Pattern in PHP.

Why? Years ago when I was first learning PHP, I wrote something similar to practice, based on the implementation present in [Pablo Dall’Oglio PHP book](https://novatec.com.br/livros/php-orientacao-objetos-4ed/). I decided to write it again, doing some improvements and writing some tests, just to play around a little bit.

Do you want to modify something? Feel free to do it and I would love to know what you did to it 👨🏻‍🎨.

**After cloning it**, run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

What that does? Calls a script to download, verify and install composer in the current directory, and then and calls `composer install` to initialize the vendor folder.

I might implement a query builder in JavaScript and Python after this as well.
